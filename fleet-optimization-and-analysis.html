There is always improvement in business. With vehicles, this can often be seen as schedule tightness or driver satisfaction.</p><p>You might get better mileage with different vehicles or maintenance choices. Or there might be vehicles that offer better driver technology that could streamline your on-the-road workflow. You might also have cars that have reached the end of their useful life.</p><p>We can help you identify where you're losing efficiency or could streamline your fleet management to get the performance metrics you're looking for. Fleet services can help you analyze and improve your fleet, whether it's a new leased vehicle or an upgrade to the driver technology. Your fleet services team will help or assist you in implementing the optimization changes once the plan has been established.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/services/FleetServices/Pictures/Rental.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Fleet Services" data-cke-saved-src=" https://www.depts.ttu.edu/services/FleetServices/Pictures/Rental.jpg"></p><h2>Fuel Card Program</h2><p>Want to implement fuel cards for your team? Fleet services can do that for you as well. It is important to not ask drivers for company gas reimbursements when they have cars on the roads. However, it is important not to offer drivers a "blank check" that could be used for everything from gas fraud to road snacks.</p><p>The solution is in the fuel cards. A well-designed fuelcard can be used to make gas payments and limit spending to ensure that everything stays on the table.</p><p>Go Oil has a Fuel Card that can be used at more than 180K locations across the country. It also provides spending limits for drivers and detailed spending reports that detail line item spending to make sure that fuel costs and other expenses are taken care of.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 12, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/fleetservices/authors/mechanic/" rel="author">Mechanic</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/fleetservices/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/fleetservices/rent-a-vehicle.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Rent A Fleet Service Vehicle</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/fleetservices/fleet-services-building-map.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Fleet Services Building (Map) </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/fleetservices/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-07-12T06:02" class="feed__date">July 12, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/fleetservices/aquisition-and-fleet-selection.html">Aquisition and Fleet Selection</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-07-12T06:00" class="feed__date">July 12, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/fleetservices/fleet-services-building-map.html">Fleet Services Building (Map)</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-07-12T05:59" class="feed__date">July 12, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/fleetservices/rent-a-vehicle.html">Rent A Fleet Service Vehicle</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Fleet Services</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/fleetservices/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
