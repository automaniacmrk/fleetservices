There is always improvement in business. With vehicles, this can often be seen as schedule tightness or driver satisfaction.</p><p>Different vehicles, or a different choice in maintenance, might provide you with better gas mileage per vehicle. You might also find vehicles with better driver technology, which could simplify your road-trip. You might also have cars that are past their prime years.</p><p>Our fleet services can assist you in identifying areas where efficiency is low or streamline your fleet management so you get the results you want. Fleet services can help you analyze and improve your fleet, whether it's a new leased vehicle or an upgrade to the driver technology. Once a plan is set out, your fleet services team can take care of or help you implement the optimizing changes.</p><h2>Fuel Card Program</h2><p>Want to implement fuel cards for your team? Fleet services can do that for you as well. Any time you have vehicles on the road, it's important that drivers not be asked to cover company gas out of pocket. However, it is important not to offer drivers a "blank check" that could be used for everything from gas fraud to road snacks.</p><p>Fuel cards are the solution to both problems because a well-designed fuel card can provide an easy way to pay for gas while also limiting spending on a daily or weekly basis to keep everything on the table.</p><p>Go Oil offers a fuel card that is accepted at over 180K locations nationwide, provides driver spending limits, and creates detailed line-item spending reports to ensure that gas costs are always taken care of and expenses are kept entirely above-board.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.maxxfleetservicesllc.com/custom/truck_am.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Fleet Services" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Buy</h2><p>Departments begin the purchasing process by contacting the Fleet Program Manager, who will work with you and Purchasing and Business Systems to assure the timely purchase of acceptable vehicles.

Electric trucks and carts are serviced at Naumann/Hobbs and Electric Vehicle Company.</p><p>The Arizona Department of Administration (ARS 41-803(C) mandates that all costs related to maintenance or operation of state-owned vehicles must be reported annually. The program allows departments to maintain their vehicles without reporting any costs. However, departments must report the vehicle's maintenance and repair history to the Fleet Program Manager. As long as you can identify the vehicle and provide details about what services were provided, copies of bills for maintenance or repair should be sufficient.</p><h2>Rent a vehicle</h2><p>Requesting a rental from Fleet is quick and easy using the Vehicle Rental Request form. The following features are available:</p><ul><li>NAU CAS login utilizing PeopleSoft to autofill fields.</li><li>Automatic emails. The first email confirms that the request was submitted.

Keeping a fleet in top condition is what fleet services are designed to do best, and we get a lot of practice. A vehicle that is used to work does not need to be running all day.</p><p>The best way to get years of high-quality service from each vehicle is to stay on top of maintenance, and that's exactly what fleet services were originally designed to do.</p><p>Not every business that needs vehicles has the time or staff to keep a fleet tuned up and in top condition. A fleet service package can help you if your business doesn't have any mechanics. Fleet services professionals will do routine inspections and tuneups, and they can also design easy-to-follow maintenance routines that drivers can do between checkups to keep their vehicles in top condition.</p><h2>Car Wash</h2><p>Go Oil must be paid for at time of service. Payment by P-Cards is acceptable.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/fae55827-8ac8-44c5-a4c7-24da1dd3b8ab/AE14AFA5-758C-4339-9D86-7CEFFDE09C23.jpeg/:/cr=t:0%25,l:0%25,w:100%25,h:100%25/rs=h:500,cg:true" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Fleet Services" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Long Term Lease Program</h2><p>Fleet Services can help departments request long-term leasing vehicles instead of buying a vehicle.
